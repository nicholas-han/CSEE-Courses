# Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
## Project0

This is project0 of Harvard CS50W class. I create a homepage for myself.

* On the main page, people can find some basic information about me and links to other pages;
* On bio page, people can find a table about where I spent my past 25 years along with a picture of my hometown;
* On academic page, I present the courses I have taken in my undergrad and at grad school;
* On work page, I list my past internships and fulltime jobs.
